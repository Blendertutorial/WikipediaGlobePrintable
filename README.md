Printable Wikipedia Globe pieces.

I have printed WikipediaGlobePrintIndent.stl in Acrylic plastic [through ShapeWays](https://www.shapeways.com/product/38RT3NBEZ/wikipedia-puzzle-globe?optionId=61005281)

It worked well enough, and [I managed to build the puzzle globe](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikipedia_Globe_translucent_3D_printed_black_background.jpg) but the pieces are actually a bit thin to work well as a puzzle, so I am working on a thicker version. [Wikipedia globe letters.blend](https://github.com/slashme/WikipediaGlobePrintable/blob/master/Wikipedia%20globe%20letters.blend) is a work in progress: I've re-cut the letters, and this time I've inset the faces of the letters' edges so that the indented or relief edges are not vertical, but slanted. I've also kept the pieces in a globe orientation so that it's easy to make the pieces thinner or fatter, or to indent or outdent the letters, by scaling the respective vertices relative to the origin. I have written a Blender Python script to apply the required modification. The next step is to arrange the pieces for printing. I'll do that by keyframing their globe position at time 1 and a printable layout at time 10.
