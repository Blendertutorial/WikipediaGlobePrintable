Printable Wikipedia Globe pieces.

I have printed WikipediaGlobePrintIndent.stl in Acrylic plastic [through ShapeWays](https://www.shapeways.com/product/38RT3NBEZ/wikipedia-puzzle-globe?optionId=61005281)

It worked well enough, and [I managed to build the puzzle globe](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikipedia_Globe_translucent_3D_printed_black_background.jpg) but the pieces are actually a bit thin to work well as a puzzle, so I designed a thicker version. [Wikipedia globe letters.blend](https://github.com/slashme/WikipediaGlobePrintable/blob/master/Wikipedia%20globe%20letters.blend) I've kept the pieces in a globe orientation so that it's easy to make the pieces thinner or fatter, or to indent or outdent the letters, by scaling the respective vertices relative to the origin. I have written a Blender Python script to apply the required modification. I've also arranged the pieces for printing: the globe position is frame 1, and various arrangements are available along the timeline.
